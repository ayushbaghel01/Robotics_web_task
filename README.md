# Robotics Website
## WebTask for creating Home Page of Robotics Club
This static website, developed for the Robotics Club at IIT Kanpur as a web task, seamlessly integrates `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. It presents an interactive and visually appealing home page, showcasing the club's activities, achievements, and commitment to innovation in the field of robotics.

## Key Features
- **Font Styling**: The `font-family` and `font-weight` properties are applied to the entire body text, ensuring a consistent and bold appearance across the website.

- **Navigation Bar**: Custom styling for the `Bootstrap navigation bar` (`navbar-mainbg`) includes background color, padding, and border radius, creating a visually appealing header section.

- **Gallery**: Images within the gallery (`gallery`) are displayed in a flex container with wrapping, allowing for a responsive layout. Hover effects (`transform: scale(1.1)`) provide an interactive experience when users interact with gallery images.

- **About Us Section**: The "About Us" section (`about`) features custom font `styling`, `padding`, and letter-spacing, enhancing readability and visual prominence.

- **Footer**: Custom styling for the footer section (`footer`) includes a background color, border radius, and positioning. Contact information and social media icons are styled for visual appeal and user interaction.

## Navbar Slider Feature

This repository includes a JavaScript function (`navbar-slider`) designed to enhance the navigation experience on the Robotics Club website. The function dynamically adjusts the appearance of the navigation bar's slider to highlight the active menu item.

- **Dynamic Slider**: The script calculates the dimensions and position of the active menu item, animating the slider to match its size and position accurately.

- **Smooth Animation**: Utilizing CSS `transitions` and `jQuery animation methods`, the slider movement is smooth and visually appealing, enhancing user interaction.

The `navbar-slider` function is triggered upon page load and window resize events, ensuring the slider remains in sync with the active menu item. Additionally, it responds to the navbar toggle action, adjusting the slider position when the menu is expanded or collapsed.
